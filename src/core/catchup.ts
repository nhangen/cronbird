 * minute via `matchesAt`. Catch-up fires **once** for the newest missed slot of
 * each job and skips the rest (no replay storm), bounded by a look-back
 * window so a slot that is too stale to be useful is not replayed.
 *
 * Pure: the daemon injects `now`, the matcher, and the look-back. The current
 * minute is deliberately excluded — that is the live dueAt path's responsibility.

 * A per-schedule catch-up look-back derived from the schedule's own cadence,
 * so a registry with mixed cadences isn't served by one global value:
 * a 5-minutely slot shouldn't replay hours late, but a daily slot missed by an
 * overnight suspend should still catch up within a few hours.
 *
 * The cadence proxy is the MIN gap between the next {@link PERIOD_SAMPLES} fires
 * — the tightest interval the schedule fires at. Min-of-gaps (not the single
 * next gap) is deliberate: a forward sample anchored at `now` varies with wake
 * time for irregular schedules (e.g. fires at 09:00 and 12:00 give a 3h-then-21h
 * or 21h-then-3h pattern depending on `now`), whereas the min is
 * cadence-intrinsic. The result is
 * clamped to [floorMs, capMs]: sub-floor cadences clamp up (catch-up fires the
 * newest slot once regardless), and long cadences (daily, weekly) clamp down to
 * the cap — a weekly slot missed by more than the cap is deliberately not
 * replayed (don't run a stale job late at night). Unparseable / single-fire
 * schedules fall back to the floor and never throw.
 *
 * The min over a fixed sample window is an upper-bound estimate: a schedule
 * whose tightest gap only recurs beyond the window would round *up* toward the
 * cap. That errs conservative — a too-large look-back only ever replays the one
 * already-newest slot once (newest-slot semantics) and is still clamped to the
 * cap — so under-sampling can't cause a replay storm.
